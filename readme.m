ICT Laboratory Overview - CIT Master

The ANT part of the ICT laboratory held in the winter term is meant to be solved
in groups of two in an independent fashion with minimal help from tutors. You are
expected to solve problems on your own and organize your work as you see t.
As a rst step the ICT lab questions must be posted on the discussion boards available
in Stud.IP. The tutors will provide feedback after the Q/A deadline detailed in the
timetable
CIT masters are expected to implement a baseline digital communication system that
matches the description in this document. Transmitter, Receiver and a simple chan-
nel model have to be implemented using Matlab/Ovtave/Python functions to test and
simulate the whole transmission chain.
In the following, discusses the specic goals and requirements of this lab in
more detail. Then, introduces the lab dates and the general timing of the
lab over the whole winter term. explains the evaluation guidelines that will be
used to judge if the lab has been passed successfully or not. Finally, the API denitions
